# Monorepo with npm workspaces

This is an npm workspace powered by [nx](https://duckduckgo.com) to manage build artefacts, catching, dependency graphs and more.

> **Note:** Using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/pnpm-workspace_yaml) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces) might require additional setup to configure workspaces. Follow the links to the appropriate documentation.

### Installation

Use this npx script to scaffold your application

```
npx react-dojo npm-workspace
```

Follow by answering the questions and that's it.

> You can also view help for this script by passing the option `-h` to the script
>
> ```
> npx react-dojo npm-workspace -h
> ```

You should now have an npm workspace project setup.

Have at it ğŸ¤™
